## Introducing **BananAnatomy**
The newest solution to a global and current problem; that of banana oxidation!  
BananAnatomy is an Android app that allows the user to either scan or upload a picture of a banana. The app will then reveal to them the ripeness and share some world-changing facts about this sacred fruit. Are you perhaps a baker using bananas as a key ingredient? Have you ever encountered a situation where a customer throws a tantrum because the banana used in their banana ice cream was not the right ripeness? This app will solve all your banana-related issues and help you grow closer to your clientele!

## Context
Throughout our entire life, our team have had to face a serious challenge. The amount of times we have had to bake banana cakes due to overripening of bananas drives us bananas! That's why we decided to do something about this pressing global issue. Introducing BananAnatomy, the perfect Android app to verify and manage your banana stock so that you will never need to see this delicate fruit go bad again!
